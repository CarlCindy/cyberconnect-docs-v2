While the [Smart Contract Protocol](/overview/smart-contract-protocol) is the core of the decentralized social graph, the Interest Graph Engine is what enables developers to create more captivating social experiences.

CyberConnect's Interest Graph Engine indexes & aggregates on/off-chain data sources to create a holistic view of users' on-chain identiy and activities. Developers can easily leverage the indexed data and the recommendation models for user acquisition and user retention.

## Indexing 

Indexing system indexes data from _blockchains, decentralized stores, as well as off-chain platforms_ like Twitter to offer insights that can be used in various social contexts. These insights include social trading signals, gaming activities, DAO engagements, and more.

## Recommendation

Recommendation platform converts indexed data into graph representation to provide _graph-based data analysis and recommendations_. On top of this, a token-curated marketplace is built that empowers developers to build and curate better models together.
