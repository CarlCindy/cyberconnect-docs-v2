# What is a ccProfile?
In CyberConnect’s infrastructure, an identity is manifested through the ProfileNFT, otherwise known as the **ccProfile**.

Whether it’s an NFT, an ENS name, a Twitter handle, or a DID, we map all of them to one holistic identity - **ccProfile**. 

## Why not just use EVM Address?

Although addresses are great as a decentralized identifier, they lack the functionality of more complex access control and key rotation which are crucial components in a social application. 

The **ccProfile** is the entry point for every onchain actions and act just like a profile in web2 social applications. Each ccProfile is a ERC-721 NFT similar to other onchain identity except that each profile owns its paid subscribers and contents. Each real user could also have multiple profiles.
