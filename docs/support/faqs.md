**How can I mint a ccProfile NFT?**

**Is minting a ccProfile NFT free?**

**What chains are currently supported?**
- The smart contract protocol deployed on EVM-compatible blockchains like BNB Chain, ETH Mainnet, and Polygon.


**Subscribe NFT on a single chain. How is this data/logic made universal (i.e. cross-chain)? Would users who get subscribers have multiple ‘treasuries’ that receive funds respective to the chain the activity occurs or do you aggregate funds somewhere?**

- We don't aggregate the funds. However, we guarantee that ProfileNFT is reserved and unique across all deployed blockchains. For example, if you get a ProfileNFT with the handle “Alice” on the BNB chain, then “Alice” on Polygon is reserved for you. Your identity will stay the same across different blockchains. Although you can get different subscribers on different blockchains,  we offer an indexer solution on all deployed blockchains to give users a unified view of “subscription to Alice”. And it depends on the developer if they want to have a separate view of subscribers on different blockchains.
