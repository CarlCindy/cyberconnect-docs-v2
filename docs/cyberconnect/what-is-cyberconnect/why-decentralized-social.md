## Why does the world need a decentralized social graph?

## 1. Censorship

Centralized control of our social data means that a few large companies have complete control over what social opinions, ideas, and content get propagated. <br/> This censorship comes in different flavors; politically driven suspensions by platforms, nation-state pressured censoring, or unsolicited/unexplained censorships (ex. shadow banning).

## 2. Lost Creator Value

Social media content produces so much value for the world, yet in Web 2.0 content creators only capture a sliver of that value.

## 3. Data is siloed and redundant

</div>

In the centralized structure of Web 2.0, our social data/graphs are “walled gardens”. Moving your data between systems is incredibly difficult and usually not possible. This creates a high switching costs; it adds friction for users and wastes time as users repeatedly build and declare connections whenever onboarding a new application.

## 4. Stifled Innovation

Siloed data also means reduced innovation. With only a few players having access to all our data, independent developers are unable to explore that data and build useful products on top of it. If someone has an idea for a better Instagram frontend, or a better feed algorithm, they don’t have the ability to leverage all the data that’s been generated by users to build out their idea; even with consent from those users. Discord is an example of a Web2 that is slightly opening up this with their developer SDK for bots, but it’s still limited and only exposes what the company decides it wants to share
