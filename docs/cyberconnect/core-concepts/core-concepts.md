## CyberAccount
With CyberConnect V3, CyberAccount is introduced to help users onboard to multi-chain Web3 social experiences leveraging ERC-4337 Account Abstraction. Users could pay gas on any network with CYBER on one network. Track CyberAccount stats here.

## CyberGraph

CyberGraph is a censorship-resistant smart contract to record users’ content and social connections, with built-in monetization tools. It is a set of smart contracts that links user identities (CyberAcconts) to their content and social connections and enables the recording of that rich social data onto multiple EVM-compatible blockchains. Through CyberGraph’s unique, customizable middleware design, storing users’ high-unit value social data on blockchain databases unlocks several novel social networking and community-building primitives, including monetization through tokenization.

## CyberID

Much like your username on Instagram or Twitter, CyberID is an ERC-721 token that represents a unique handle for your account in the CyberConnect social network. Previously registered CyberProfiles in CyberConnect V2 will be able to upgrade to CyberIDs soon. Track CyberConnect V2 stats here.

## W3ST(Web3StatusToken)

W3ST is a non-transferrable NFT with an on-chain issuer reference that acts as a digitally verifiable indicator of a user’s status in their community. It is a powerful instrument for users to find their tribe in Web3. Organizations use W3ST to recognize their most engaged and loyal supporters and build a digitally verifiable, immutable, and contextually meaningful contribution-based value system in their communities.

# Introducing CYBER, The Governance Token

## Governance

CYBER token holders have voting power and can delegate their voting power to others. Protocol improvements are decided based on voting power.

## Payment for CyberID

CYBER could be used for payment when purchasing CyberID.

##  CyberAccount gas token

CYBER could be used as the price meter and means of payment for gas fees for all transactions within CyberAccount across EVM-compatible chains. More CYBER use cases shall be introduced by CyberDAO in the future.
