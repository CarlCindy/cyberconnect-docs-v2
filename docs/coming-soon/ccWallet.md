# ccWallet: CyberConnect's Smart Contract Wallet

It’s no secret that the current user onboarding in Web3 is marred with poor UX/UI, thus becoming a critical barrier of entry for dApps to reach mass adoption. In our efforts to grow Link3 and support our ecosystem partners, we’ve realized that building a decentralized social graph and identity solution is just not enough. In order for Web3 social to compete with the incumbents, users need a frictionless account-creation and log-in solution that matches and exceeds the experience currently offered by Web2 incumbants (i.e. Google/Meta).

As a result, we are building a smart contract wallet solution that will be closely integrated with the universal cc Profile account system to offer dApp developers a one-stop solution. This will empower users to create a crypto wallet with an embedded decentralized identity.

### Once complete, the ccWallet will offer:

1. **Seedless onboarding:** experience with Web2 social login and multi-chain support.
2. **Non-custodial design:** with both gasless (enabled by MPC-TSS technology) and on-chain social recovery (enabled by multi-sig guardian network).
3. **Support for gas fee delegation/marketplace:** through the implementation of an ERC-4337 compatible design.
4. **Cross-chain gas fee payment with one click**
5. **Native integration with CyberConnect Social Graph protocol** to offer a unique and comprehensive Web3 social experience (e.g. identity/social relationship service, SBT-issuing infrastructure, token-gated content, and end-to-end encrypted private messaging).
6. **Fiat cash-in**.
