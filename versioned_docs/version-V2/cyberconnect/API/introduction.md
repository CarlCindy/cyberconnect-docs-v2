Welcome to CyberConnect's API documentation. We chose to use **GraphQL** for our API because it allows for more flexibility and precision in querying data compared to traditional REST APIs.

With GraphQL, clients have the ability to request exactly the data they need and receive it in a predictable format. This reduces the amount of unnecessary data transfer and allows for more efficient use of network resources. Additionally, GraphQL allows for real-time updates and subscriptions, making it a great fit for building interactive, data-driven applications. Overall, the use of GraphQL allows for a more efficient and streamlined developer experience.
