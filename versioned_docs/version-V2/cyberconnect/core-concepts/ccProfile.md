# ccProfileNFT
Within CyberConnectâ€™s on-chain social graph, an identity is manifested through a **ccProfileNFT**. Whether itâ€™s an NFT, an ENS name, a Twitter handle, or a DID, we map all of them to one holistic identity - **ccProfileNFT**. Developers can integrate the ccProfileNFT into their dApp/protocol to benefit from the existing network of identities being built through Link3 and other CyberConnect integrated protocols.

The ccProfileNFT serves as a prerequisite for users who want to issue/post content (i.e. issue their custom EssenceNFTs) or form connections (i.e. issue their custom SubscribeNFTs). The deployed ccProfileNFT contract is used as the gateway for users to perform actions such as collecting essence, creating a profile, and subscribing to a profile in a specific dApp context. 


:::info 
All Link3 profiles will soon be upgraded to ccProfiles as part of our universal Web3 account system. Going forward, all future users will mint their .cc profile handle through [the protocol website cc.me](https://cc.me), and use that handle as their Web3 identity across dApps integrated with CyberConnect protocol. **Users who mint profile on one chain will have the ability to claim the same handle across all supported chains (only paying gas fee.)**

## Why not just use EVM Address?

Although addresses are great as a decentralized identifier, they lack the functionality of more complex access control and key rotation which are crucial components in a social application. 

The **ccProfile** is the entry point for every onchain actions and act just like a profile in web2 social applications. Each ccProfileNFT is a ERC-721 NFT similar to other onchain identity except that each profile owns its paid subscribers and contents. Each real user could also have multiple profiles. See a profile in action on [Link3](https://link3.to/shiyu).
