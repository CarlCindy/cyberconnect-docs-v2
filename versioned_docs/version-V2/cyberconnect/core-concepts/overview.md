The CyberConnect protocol consists of a set generative smart contracts deployed on BNB chain. Generative smart contracts means the protocol will generate a set of new smart contracts associated with dApps or users when they interact with the protocol. This pattern is similar to the Uniswap protocol where a set of liquidity pair smart contracts will be generated when people create a new liquidity pool.

We have the indexed data schema designed as below that represents social relationships on CyberConnect. You can find the more detailed gql schema on our [API Playground](https://api.cyberconnect.dev/playground) and query subfields that all start from the `wallet` field.

You can find query examples & the GraphQL schema in Apollo for your reference.
