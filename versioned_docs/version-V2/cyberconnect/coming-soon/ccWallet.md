# ccWallet: CyberConnect's Smart Contract Wallet

Itâ€™s no secret that the current user onboarding in Web3 is marred with poor UX/UI, thus becoming a critical barrier of entry for dApps to reach mass adoption. In our efforts to grow Link3 and support our ecosystem partners, weâ€™ve realized that building a decentralized social graph and identity solution is just not enough. In order for Web3 social to compete with the incumbents, users need a frictionless account-creation and log-in solution that matches and exceeds the experience currently offered by Web2 incumbents (i.e. Google/Meta).

As a result, we are building a smart contract wallet solution that will be closely integrated with the universal cc Profile account system to offer dApp developers a one-stop solution. This will empower users to create a crypto wallet with an embedded decentralized identity.

Coming in April 2023 ðŸ‘€
