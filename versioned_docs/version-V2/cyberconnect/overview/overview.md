CyberConnect has two components to help developer build social applications: 
1. [Smart Contract Protocol](/overview/smart-contract-protocol)  
 - The Smart Contract Protocol represents the core of CyberConnect's social graph. It consists of various ERC721 based contracts (incl. ccProfileNFT, SubscribeNFT, & EssenceNFT) that together form the nodes & edges of the open & decentralized social graph. 
2. [Interest Graph Engine](/overview/interest-graph-engine)
 - The Interest Graph Engine indexes, aggregates onchain and offchain data sources related to an identity and its activities to create a holistic view. Developers could easily leverage the indexed data and the recommendation models for user acquisition and user retention.
