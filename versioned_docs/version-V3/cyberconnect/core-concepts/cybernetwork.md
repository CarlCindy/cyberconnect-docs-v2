Blockchains were designed for a decentralized, transparent, secure, and immutable system for recording and verifying information. However, actually storing data on existing blockchains is expensive. So, even though representing social data on the blockchain is good for programmability and interoperability, high gas costs are an incredibly challenging bottleneck for scaling web3 social networks to a billion users. In the last 11 months, over $2M in gas fees was paid by 1.3M users on CyberConnect V2 alone. Users need a better alternative that is dramatically scalable without compromising their data ownership.

In the coming months, we will introduce additional upgrades to the CyberConnect social network to make all social interactions/transactions much cheaper.
