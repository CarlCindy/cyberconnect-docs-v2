<Tooltip anchorId="social-graph" content="Social graphs describe relationships on the Internet, making them a representation of the social system online" />

CyberConnect is a decentralized <strong id="social-graph" class="boxBorder"> social graph </strong> protocol. CyberConnect harnesses blockchain technology to empower users with ownership of their identity, content, and social data. In doing so, we enable both users and developers to experience a range of exciting new social networking primitives that are interoperable, censorship-resistant, and decentralized.


<Tooltip anchorId="EVM-CHAIN" html="EVM chain here refers to any blockchain that can <br/>run the ethereum virutal machine and execute <br/>Ethereum smart contracts. CyberConnect is <br/>currently deployed on ETH & BNB." />

Built on <strong id="EVM-CHAIN" class="boxBorderEVM"> EVM chains</strong>, CyberConnect empowers users to truly own their social identities, contents, and connections in a social network and provides developers with a rich set of tools to build applications with meaningful social experiences.
