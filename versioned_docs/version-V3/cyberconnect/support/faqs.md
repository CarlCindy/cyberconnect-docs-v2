### **Roadmap**

CyberConnect V3 will be available for use in the coming days, beginning with Link3.

In the coming weeks, we will officially roll out the upgraded CyberConnect social network to multiple L1 and L2 blockchain networks through an exclusive launch campaign with Link3 called, **CyberVoyage.** We invite web3 teams across ecosystems to join us. More details will be shared soon.

**Collect this post and unlock limited-edition early supporter benefits to commemorate this monumental upgrade to CyberConnect and usher web3 social to its new, multi-chain future.** More details about the benefits will be announced next week, along with more information on CyberVoyage.

Additional developer toolkits with an updated indexer and API server will be made available in August.
